    "#### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Groq API:** Large Language Model provider using llama3-70b-8192 model for all AI-powered analysis  \n",
    "> **tiktoken:** Token estimation using cl100k_base encoding for cost tracking and optimization  \n",
    "> **python-dotenv:** Environment variable management for secure API key handling  \n",
    "> **asyncio:** Asynchronous programming support for parallel processing of pipeline stages  \n",
    "> **numpy:** Numerical operations for similarity calculations in task merging algorithm  \n",
    "> **sklearn:** Machine learning utilities (TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity) for semantic analysis  \n",
    "> **networkx:** Graph creation and manipulation for dependency visualization  \n",
    "> **plotly:** Interactive visualization of task dependency graphs with hover details  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TokenTracker:** Monitors API usage across all pipeline stages, tracks input/output tokens per operation (task_extraction, story_point_estimation, required_skills, dependency_analysis, format_validation), estimates costs using configurable rates, and provides efficiency metrics with percentage breakdowns using tiktoken's cl100k_base encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TaskExtractorAgent:** Decomposes user stories into atomic, actionable tasks (maximum 8 per story) using self-consistency approach with 3 samples at different temperatures (0.2, 0.4, 0.6). Applies task cleaning to remove explanatory text and convert to imperative form. Key method: `decompose(user_story, num_samples=3) -> List[str]`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **StoryPointEstimatorAgent:** Estimates task complexity using Fibonacci sequence [1,2,3,5,8,13] with few-shot learning from curated examples. Considers complexity, time, risk, and uncertainty factors. Key method: `estimate_story_points(user_story, tasks) -> Dict` returns `{'total_story_points': int, 'task_points': Dict, 'estimated_sum': int}`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **RequiredSkillsAgent:** Maps technical and domain skills to tasks including programming languages (javascript, python), frameworks (react, django), tools (database_design, api_development), and soft skills. Optimized for batch processing of all tasks in single API call. Key method: `identify_skills(user_story, tasks) -> Dict[str, List[str]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **DependencyAgent:** Identifies inter-task dependencies using self-consistency approach across 3 samples. Assigns rework effort scoring (1=low, 2=moderate, 3=high rework required). Key method: `analyze_dependencies(user_story, tasks, story_points) -> Dict` returns dependency mappings with prerequisite tasks and effort estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TaskMergerAgent:** - performs semantic similarity analysis using TF-IDF vectorization (ngram_range=(1,3), max_features=1500) and cosine similarity with configurable threshold (default 0.4). Clusters similar tasks across user stories and merges them intelligently. Key method: `merge_similar_tasks(all_results) -> List[Dict]`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **SimpleGraphVisualizer:** Creates interactive dependency graphs from JSON results using NetworkX and Plotly. Displays task relationships, story points (node size), rework effort (edge annotations), and multi-story task sources. Key method: `create_dependency_graph(pipeline_results) -> plotly.Figure`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **FormatValidator:** Validates output structure ensuring required fields (description, id, user_stories, story_points, depends_on, required_skills) and JSON serialization. Provides error handling and fallback mechanisms. Key method: `validate_and_format(user_story, tasks_data, total_story_points) -> Dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "> **process_multiple_user_stories_pipeline(user_stories: List[str]):** Main multi-story pipeline orchestrator executing 6-step workflow: (1) Individual story processing, (2) Task extraction with self-consistency, (3) Parallel story points + skills analysis using asyncio.gather(), (4) Dependency analysis, (5) Format validation, (6) Semantic task merging across all stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **process_user_story_pipeline(user_story: str):** Single story pipeline executing sequential workflow with parallel processing in steps 2-3 for story points and skills identification, followed by dependency analysis and format validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **decompose(user_story: str, num_samples=3):** Extracts actionable tasks using self-consistency approach with multiple LLM samples at varying temperatures. Applies task cleaning, normalization, and consistency voting. Returns maximum 8 imperative-form tasks with parsing resilience for malformed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **merge_similar_tasks(all_results: List[Dict]):** Performs semantic task merging using TF-IDF similarity matrix calculation, task clustering with configurable threshold, and intelligent merging preserving skills, story points, and dependencies. Updates task IDs and rebuilds dependency references across merged tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **estimate_story_points(user_story, tasks):** Uses few-shot learning with domain-specific examples to estimate complexity. Returns `{'total_story_points': int, 'task_points': Dict, 'estimated_sum': int}` using Fibonacci sequence with automatic correction for invalid values and fallback to moderate complexity (3 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **identify_skills(user_story, tasks):** Maps technical skills per task in single API call for efficiency. Returns `{'task_description': ['skill1', 'skill2']}` covering programming languages, frameworks, domain expertise, and technical disciplines with fallback to [\"general_development\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "> **analyze_dependencies(user_story, tasks, story_points):** Identifies logical task dependencies using self-consistency across multiple analyses. Returns `{'dependent_task': [{'task_id': 'prerequisite_task', 'rework_effort': 1-3}]}` based on workflow order and technical requirements with consensus voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **create_dependency_graph(pipeline_results):** Generates interactive Plotly visualization from JSON results showing task nodes (sized by story points), dependency edges with rework effort indicators, and hover details including merged task sources and required skills.##\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Similarity and Cross-Story Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Merge Tasks Across User Stories?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Dependencies exist not just within individual user stories, but **across the entire project scope**:\n",
    "* Story A: \"As a user, I want to create an account...\"\n",
    "* Story B: \"As a user, I want to log in to my account...\"\n",
    "* Story C: \"As a user, I want to reset my password...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Story Dependency Chain:** Story A: Create Account → Story B: Login System → Story C: Password Reset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extended Problem**: Different user stories often describe the same underlying work:\n",
