RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================================

💡 IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Overall F1-Score is low (0.000)
    • Review dependency detection algorithm
    • Consider improving task relationship analysis
    • Validate training data or rule-based logic
  🟡 LOW PRECISION (0.000): Too many false dependencies
    • Tighten dependency detection criteria
    • Improve task similarity matching
    • Add more restrictive filters
  🟡 LOW RECALL (0.000): Missing many dependencies
    • Expand dependency detection patterns
    • Consider more relationship types
    • Review task parsing logic
  🟡 LOW PERFECT MATCHES (0.0%)
    • Focus on exact dependency identification
    • Improve task description matching
    • Validate dependency ordering logic
